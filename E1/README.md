# E1: 2 (blocks/no blocks) x 3 (no scaffolding, self-explanation, goal structure labels)

## Participants

- Psyc subject pool, primarily freshmen

## Design

**Topic is "Nature of Data" notebook**

- Pre experiment survey (~5 min; attitudes about data science/learning with computer tutor)
- Pretest (~15 min)
    - Assess <, >, =
    - Determine additional concepts from final training materials
- Training video for system
    - Code cells, running them to produce outputs, using Blockly to populate code cells
    - Basic navigation in Blockly: getting/connecting blocks, block fields, copy/paste blocks, sync
    - Troubleshooting: dead kernel, wiggle blocks, blocks not sticking together
    - Block tooltips (e.g. <, >, =)
- Worked example (~20 minutes)
    - Nature of data notebook
        - Keep: types of variables, tabular data
        - Remove: types of data, matching data to questions, limits of analysis, measurement
        - Includes filtering rows of dataframe, e.g. < 3
- Practice problems (~40 minutes)
    - Near transfer (with worked example available; change number on filter, e.g. < 10)
    - Near transfer (without worked example available; change number as before, but different)
    - Far transfer (e.g. > 7)
    - Farther transfer (e.g. = "Smoking")
- Posttest (~15 min)
- Post experiment survey (~5 min; satisfaction, gender/ethnicity, educational achievement)
- Ravens ~20 min if we have time
