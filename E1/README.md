# E1: 2 (blocks/no blocks) x 3 (no scaffolding, self-explanation, goal structure labels)

## Participants

- Psyc subject pool, primarily freshmen

## Design

**Topic is "Nature of Data" notebook**

- Pre experiment survey (attitudes about data science/learning with computer tutor)
- Pretest
    - Assess <, >, =
    - Determine additional concepts from final training materials
- Training video for system
    - Code cells, running them to produce outputs, using Blockly to populate code cells​ 
    - Basic navigation in Blockly: getting/connecting blocks, block fields, copy/paste blocks, sync​ 
    - Troubleshooting: dead kernel, wiggle blocks, blocks not sticking together​ 
    - Block tooltips (e.g. <, >, =)
- Worked example (~30 minutes)
    - Nature of data​ notebook
        - Keep: types of variables, tabular data​ 
        - Remove: types of data, matching data to questions, limits of analysis, measurement​ 
        - Includes filtering rows of dataframe, e.g. < 3
- Practice problems (~30 minutes)
    - Near transfer (change number on filter, e.g. < 10)
    - Far transfer (e.g. > 7)
    - Farther transfer (e.g. = "Smoking")
- Posttest
- Post experiment survey (satisfaction, gender/ethnicity, educational achievement)
- AX CPT, 1 block ~7min
- **Possibly do Ravens ~20 min if we have time**

**NOTE: can we include both procedural knowledge and correct interpretation in transfer?**
