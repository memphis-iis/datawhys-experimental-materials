    "## Types of variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured data begins with **measurements** of some type of thing in the real world, which we call a **variable**.\n",
    "Consider the example of height. \n",
    "I may measure 10 people and find that their heights in centimeters are:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Height |\n",
    "|--------|\n",
    "| 165    |\n",
    "| 188    |\n",
    "| 153    |\n",
    "| 164    |\n",
    "| 150    |\n",
    "| 190    |\n",
    "| 169    |\n",
    "| 163    |\n",
    "| 165    |\n",
    "| 190    |\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these values (e.g. 165) is a measurement of the variable *height*.\n",
    "We call *height* a variable because its value isn't constant.\n",
    "If everyone in the world were the same height, we wouldn't call height a variable, and we also wouldn't bother measuring it, because we'd know everyone is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables have different **types** that can affect your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nominal\n",
    "\n",
    "A nominal variable consists of unordered categories, like *male* or *female* for biological sex.\n",
    "Notice that these categories are not numbers, and there is no order to the categories.\n",
    "We do not say that male comes before female or is smaller than female.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ordinal\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal variables consist of ordered categories.\n",
    "You can think of it as nominal data but with an ordering from first to last or smallest to largest.\n",
    "A common example of ordinal data are Likert questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(1) Strongly disagree\n",
    "(2) Disagree\n",
    "(3) Neither agree nor disagree\n",
    "(4) Agree\n",
    "(5) Strongly agree\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though these options are numbered 1 to 5, those numbers only indicate which comes before the others, not how \"big\" an option is.\n",
    "For example, we wouldn't say that the difference between *Agree*  and *Disagree* is the same as the difference between *Neither agree nor disagree* and *Strongly agree*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interval\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval variables are ordered *and* their measurement scales are evenly spaced.\n",
    "A classic example is temperature in Fahrenheit.\n",
    "In degrees Fahrenheit, the difference between 70 and 71 is the same as the difference between 90 and 91 - either case is one degree.\n",
    "The other most important characteristic of interval variables is also the most confusing one, which is that interval variables don't have a meaningful zero value.\n",
    "Degrees Fahrenheit is an example of this because there's nothing special about 0 degrees. \n",
    "0 degrees doesn't mean there's no temperature or no heat energy, it's just an arbitrary point on the scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "Ratio variables are like interval variables but with meaningful zeros.\n",
    "Age and height are good examples because 0 age means you have no age, and 0 height means you have no height.\n",
    "The name *ratio* reflects that you can form a ratio with these variables, which means that you can say age 20 is twice as old as age 10.\n",
    "Notice you can't say that about degrees Fahrenheit: 100 degrees is not really twice as hot as 50 degrees, because 0 degrees Fahrenheit doesn't mean \"no temperature.\""

    "## Tabular data\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common type of structured data is **tabular data** which is what you find in spreadsheets.\n",
    "If you've ever used a spreadsheet, you know something about tabular data!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of tabular data, with *height* in centimeters, *age* in years, and *weight* in kilograms:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Height | Age | Weight |\n",
    "|--------|-----|--------|\n",
    "| 161    | 50  | 53     |\n",
    "| 161    | 17  | 53     |\n",
    "| 155    | 33  | 84     |\n",
    "| 180    | 51  | 84     |\n",
    "| 186    | 18  | 88     |\n",
    "\n",
    "In tabular data like this, each **row** is a person.\n",
    "More generically, we would say each row is an **observation** or **datapoint** (in statistics terminology) or an **item** (in machine learning terminology).\n",
    "In each row, we have measurements for each of our variables for that particular person.\n",
    "Since we have five rows of measurements, we know that there are five people in this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also think about tabular data in terms of **columns**.\n",
    "Each column represents a variable, with the name of that variable in the **column header**.\n",
    "For example, *height* is at the top of the first column and is the name of the variable for that column.\n",
    "Importantly, the header is not an observation but rather a description of our data.\n",
    "This is why we don't count the header when we are counting the rows in our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Delimited tabular data - CSV and TSV\n",
    "\n",
    "You are probably familiar with spreadsheet files, e.g. Microsoft Excel has files that end in `.xls` or `.xlsx`.\n",
    "However, in data science, it is more common to have tabular data files that are **delimited**.\n",
    "A delimited file is just a plain text file where column boundaries are represented by a specific character, usually a comma or a tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what the data above looks like in **comma separated value (CSV)** form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Height,Age,Weight\n",
    "161,50,53\n",
    "161,17,53\n",
    "155,33,84\n",
    "180,51,84\n",
    "186,18,88\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and here's what the data looks like in **tab separated value (TSV)** form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Height\tAge\tWeight\n",
    "161\t50\t53\n",
    "161\t17\t53\n",
    "155\t33\t84\n",
    "180\t51\t84\n",
    "186\t18\t88\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of the delimiter (comma, tab, or something else) is really arbitrary, but it's always better to use a delimiter that doesn't appear in your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataframes\n",
    "\n",
    "Data scientists often load tabular data into a **dataframe** that they can manipulate in a program.\n",
    "In other words, tabular data from a file is brought into the computational notebook in a variable that represents rows, columns, header, etc just like they are stored in the tabular data file.\n",
    "Because dataframes match tabular data in files, they are very intuitive to work with, which may explain their popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're now at the practical portion of this notebook, so let's work with dataframes!"
