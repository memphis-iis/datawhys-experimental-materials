# datawhys-experimental-materials

This repository contains textual materials for experiments under the DataWhys project (stimuli, instruments, surveys, etc.).

## What to include

Materials that are primarily text should be stored in the manner in which they are delivered, e.g. Jupyter notebooks in their original form.

When instruments are delivered using simple formats/software we do not control, such as Qualtrics or Google Forms, they should be stored as a PDF snapshot of corresponding web pages.

When instruments are in cloud containers like [expfactory-experiments](https://github.com/), this repository should contain appropriate versioning and set up information for reproducibility purposes.

Images and video should be stored with care. GitHub is not designed for that kind of data, which can lead to an explosion of storage in the version history. However, if the total size is relatively small, **and only the final files are stored here**, then storing them in this repository may be warranted. Handling of large files should be determined on a case by case basis.


## Experiments

The main experiments for DataWhys are E1-E9 as listed in the proposal. Materials for each experiment are held in a corresponding folder.

- E1: 2 (blocks/no blocks) x 3 (no scaffolding, self-explanation, goal structure labels), freshman
- E2-E9 (todo)
